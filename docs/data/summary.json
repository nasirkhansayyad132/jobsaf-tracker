به پیش میبرد. بعد از تأسیس د افغانستان بانک وظایف بانکداری دولتی به شمول چاپ و نشر پول افغانی به این بانک منتقل گردید. د افغانستان بانک بحیث بانکدار دولت و بانک تجارتی توانست تحولات و انکشافات چشمگیر و بزرگی را هم در رابطه به چاپ و نشر پول افغانی به وجود آورد و هم در سمت و سوی نظام بانکی به دستاورد های نائل گردد. فعالیت د افغانستان بانک را می توان به دو مرحله تقسیم بندی کرد: در مرحله اول که از سال 1318 الی سال 1380 را احتوا می نماید؛ د افغانستان بانک در قسمت چاپ، ضرب و نشر پول افغانی مطابق به تقاضای بازار، حفظ ارزش پول و امور بانکداری دولتی مصروف بود که در پهلوی این وظایف، امور تجارتی را نیز

مرحله دوم از سال 1381 آغاز می شود. بعد از تصویب قانون اساسی افغانستان، بانک مرکزی بر اساس ماده دوازدهم این قانون، منحیث یک بانک مستقل تسجیل گردید و با صلاحیت هایی که به آن تفویض شد به دستاورد های قابل توجهی در عرصه های گوناگون دست یافت. د افغانستان بانک بر اساس قوانین جدید بانکی و مالی تمام امور تجارتی را به بانکهای دولتی و خصوصی واگذار نمود و مسوولیت اعطای جواز فعالیت و نظارت از مؤسسات بانکی و مالی را بعهده گرفت. بر اساس قانون د افغانستان بانک، ثبات قیم هدف اولیه و اساسی د افغانستان بانک می باشد و به این منظور طرح، تطبیق و اتخاذ سیاست های پولی، سیاست ارز و ترتیبات اسعار، چاپ بانکنوت و ضرب مسکوکات از وظایف بانک مرکزی تعیین گردید که در کنار آن طبق قانون به حیث بانکدار و نماینده مالی دولت، نهاد صدور و ثبت جواز فعالیت بانکها، صرافان و عرضه کنندگان خدمات پولی و اسناد بهادار و سیستم پرداخت
